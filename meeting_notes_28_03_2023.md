### Next Steps
    - Create Benchmarking Suite (Vignesh)
        - Recreate results from CTGAN paper
    - Read CT-GAN and AE-GAN papers to understand the workings of the AE-GAN 
      framework (Everyone)
    - Swapping out AE: Denoising AE (Jimmy) and Variational AE (Sumant)
        - Check for existing implementation of AE GAN
    - Check for possibilities in the framework for AE-GAN (change inputs to the Encoder ?)
    - Experiment with VAE-GAN (Vignesh)
