- GNNs for DNA

- Youtube playlist for Graph Neural Network
    - Relatively new
    - Math heavy
    - Graph convolution
        - Tabular data
        - Embeddings
    - Potential avenues
      - Drug discovery
    - Youtube tutorials
    - University research paper instead of Google

- CT GAN
    - Dataset with continous variable data
      - Different representation for categorical (one hot encoding)
    - Mode specific
    - Estimate multimodal gaussian distribution
    - Input vectors are very sparse, we want it to be dense for network training
        - We can use embeddings from auto encoder
    - Start date and end date
    - Another extension: Tabular synthesis time series data synthesis
    - Infuse GNN and CT GAN, not sure if feasible
    - What dataset will we use
        - Simulated and actual
    - Model compression
